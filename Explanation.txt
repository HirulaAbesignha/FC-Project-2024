
This system is an automated smart irrigation and monitoring solution designed to take care of plants by managing soil moisture, sunlight, and water levels. It consists of several components that work together to ensure the plant gets adequate care while minimizing human intervention. Let me explain each feature in detail:

1. Components of the System:

ESP32 Microcontroller: The brain of the system, responsible for controlling all the sensors, motors, and interacting with the user through buttons and the LCD screen.
Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures the moisture level in the soil. It provides an analog value that indicates whether the soil is too dry, too wet, or just right.
Water Pump (Motor): Activates to water the plant when the soil moisture is below a predefined threshold, ensuring the plant gets enough water when needed.
Ultraviolet (UV) Sensor: Measures the intensity of sunlight. If the sunlight is too low, it helps to notify the user or turn on an LED to alert the system.
Water Level Sensor: Measures the amount of water in the tank or reservoir. If the water level falls below a certain threshold, it will trigger an alert to the user.
LCD Screen (16x2): Displays the current date, time, moisture level, sunlight level, and other relevant information to the user.
LEDs: Indicate different statuses like sunlight (low sunlight), moisture (low moisture), and motor (when the pump is on or off).
Buttons: The user can press these to manually check moisture, sunlight, or activate the pump for watering.

2. How the System Works:
Monitoring Soil Moisture: The system continuously monitors the moisture level in the soil through an analog sensor. If the soil moisture level falls below a predefined threshold (10% in this case), the system will trigger the water pump for a set duration (15 seconds in this case) to water the plant.

Scheduled Watering: The system can water the plant based on a scheduled time. For example, the system is set to water the plant in the morning (6:30–8:30) and afternoon (2:30–4:30) if the moisture level is low. This feature is particularly useful for automating watering during certain hours of the day.

Checking Sunlight: The UV sensor measures the sunlight intensity and maps it to a percentage. If the sunlight is too low (below 10%), the system alerts the user by displaying a message on the LCD and turning on an LED to indicate low sunlight.

Water Level Monitoring: The system reads the water level in the tank using a water level sensor. If the water level is below 15%, an alert is triggered, and the system will turn on an LED to show that the water supply is low.

Manual Control: The system is designed for manual interaction via buttons. The user can press a button to:

Check the Sunlight Level: Display the sunlight intensity on the screen.
Check the Moisture Level: Display the moisture percentage in the soil.
Manually Activate the Water Pump: If the user wants to water the plant immediately, they can manually trigger the water pump.
Power Management:

The system has a power button that allows the user to turn the ESP32 on or off. When the system is off, it enters deep sleep mode to save energy.
There is a Power LED that indicates whether the system is turned on or off. If the system is on, the LED will light up.
Real-Time Clock (RTC): An RTC (Real-Time Clock) keeps track of the current date and time. The system displays the date and time on the LCD to keep the user informed. It also helps in scheduled watering, where the system triggers watering based on the current time.

3. Automatic and Manual Interaction:
Automatic Watering: The system automatically activates the water pump if the moisture level is low and the time is within the scheduled watering range. For example, if the soil is dry and the current time falls between 6:30 AM and 8:30 AM or 2:30 PM and 4:30 PM, the system will water the plant for 15 seconds.
Manual Control: If the user wants to manually intervene, they can use the buttons to check the moisture level, sunlight level, or trigger the water pump manually. This allows the user to control the system at any time, giving them more flexibility.

4. Deep Sleep Mode:
The system includes a feature where the ESP32 can go into deep sleep mode to conserve power when not needed. This is useful in case you want to save energy and keep the system in a low-power state when it's not being actively used.

5. Display and Feedback:
The system provides real-time information to the user through the LCD screen. It displays:
The current time and date.
The moisture level in the soil (as a percentage).
The sunlight level (as a percentage).
The status of the water pump.

Additionally, LED indicators provide visual feedback about:
The current sunlight level (via the sunlight LED).
The moisture level (via the moisture LED).
The water pump’s status (via the motor LED).
The power state of the system (via the power LED).

6. Conclusion:
This automated irrigation system makes it easier to take care of plants by monitoring key environmental factors (moisture, sunlight, water level) and automatically watering the plants when needed. It also provides users with the flexibility to check conditions manually and control the system via buttons. The system helps save water, energy, and time while ensuring plants get the care they need for healthy growth.
